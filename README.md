# Lending_club
• Given the data of previous customers, perfom data exploration and visualization to see if there is any
relationship between the customers’ features and if they paid the loan or not

• Preprocess the data to fill in any null values and potentially create a model to predict the missing data

• Create categorical variables and dummy variables and also normalizing the data to prevent data leakage from
the test set when split the data set

• Build a deep learning neural network model using Keras, a library associates with tensorFlow to predict if the
future customers will pay back the loan
